  To Whomever it may concern,                                           05/09/18
                                                                                I would like to first off thank your organization for instilling in me joy and respect for theater and performance arts. I look back happily on pictures of myself as "Jackie Lope", a tall-tale-themed pun on Jackalope in an early RCLT production I've since forgot the name of. As I have returned to New Mexico and am beginning my career as a web developer, I have been looking for an opportunity to connect to my roots, as it were. After I saw an amazing production of Les Miserables at Popejoy Hall, I remember fondly my first experiences on stage with RCLT. I looked for your organization's web presence and would like to extend my services pro-bono not only to build my portfolio but also to give back to what has given me so much, and ideally assist with the continuing improvement of your operation.
                                                                                After my time in Roswell, I have had the good fortune of viewing amazing shows wherever I go, and a passion for theater has been a constant in my life amidst so much other change. Some of my favorites include "Come From Away" in New York, "I am The Machine Gunner" at the Fringe festival in Philadelphia, and an incredible rendition of Othello in Nashville. I believe that with my skills from Vanderbilt University, New Mexico Military Institute (NMMI), and the local Deep Dive Coding, I will be a crucial value-add for your company and our collaboration will be an entirely productive endeavor. I look forward to hearing from you!
