			<h2>3 Qualitative features: strength and weakness </h2>
			<h3>Empathetic</h3>
			<p> can identify with each individual within a complex process and such can often
				piece together an emotional understanding of any problems or animosity that arises
				and, on occasion, have predicted where this could occur and took preventative measures
				Also, I can utilize empathy to be able to communicate effectively to many
				different sorts of individuals -- a colloquialism/social translator --
				Con: I can sometimes value other's emotions too much and have trouble making
				hard decisions.</p>
			<h3>Vision--Imaginative</h3>
			<p>Pros: I am able to synthesize observations, data, and relationships to
				conceive and/or understand underlying causes of everyday things, institutions
				long-standing animosity, etc
				Cons: pseudo naivety--my optimism and vision together can inhibit practical
				Accomplishments, can strain relationships, and let me turn ignore potential
				problems</p>

			<h3>Passion</h3>
			<p>
				When I find an inherent "why" for a particular project, I am excellent at internalizing and pressing on
				beyond what might be reasonable or normal to dedicate myself until the project is complete
				The flip side of this is my "tunnel vision" can cause me to isolate and perhaps make reckless
				mistakes I would not make in a normal setting. I am working at mitigating this and externalizing,
				periodic reflection/commenting as well as collaborating with a detail-oriented individual are strategies for
				success.

			<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
			<p id="pitch">Hey I'm Gus and I'm using technology to bring me people closer together, all through the
				celebration
				of good
				food, and the people that make it. Dining together is tradition, and has built communities for centuries.
				Want
				to grab a bite and hear how it works?

			<h3><a href="stovetop3.pdf">Space Is Huge (stovetop)</a></h3>
			<p>Optimism may be a weakness, but I'm proud of my vision that will become <i>New Mexico News Chain</i>.</p>
			<p>This is largely dependent on intermediate steps and my personal journey <a href="stovetop3.pdf">goals</a>
				runs
				parallel to this startup's development curve.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="activity">
			<ul>
				<li>
					I live with pride of my family: my brothers give me constant support, and my mother surely only thinks of
					how to aid my success. I believe them now as I understand it takes internalized motivators as well as
					external to guide success. Or maybe just internal ones.
				</li>
				<li>
					The external factors that keep me from reaching my goals have been surmounted. I have for months set it
					up
					such that nothing can stand in my way to excel in this bootcamp, that is, externally. I practice everyday
					strategies to ground myself, as disorganization and time management have in the past been serious
					internal obstacles.
					The good news is, nonetheless, that these can also be conquered!
				</li>
				<li>
					The most important way to create value for others currently is to double down on my own successs. The
					stage I
					am at now is one of delayed gratifaction, so my other outreach notwithstanding, I am looking to improve
					myself so that i give back to those that have given me so much.

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>With a sincere optimism: I understand my chaos. I had trouble waking up until I
				set up an alarm that I have to go across the room to turn off. I appreciate my reasoning
				and problem solving skills- and have reasoned how its most difficult and most rewarding
				to solve my own problems- so when I'm working for a team I know exactly how I Can
				contribute most effectively as well as the pitfalls that can lead me to burdening
				the cause. I argue that recognizing my weakness is not a reason to write me off,
				because the strengths I take pride are rooted in overcoming them. Distractability
				can allow me to identify idiosychrocies and create innovate solutions, but only
				when mitigated with strict time management. My vision, empathy, and optimism can allow
				me to conceptualize awesome things, and potentially to help build my UNICORN ***
				With this in mind I will appreciate the break this weekend represents after an intense
				albeit engaging week 1. From our first minimal-mouse-monday my brain already seems to
				be reconfiguring itself as a <i> developing machine </i>, and even just over the
				course of this first week I recognize what I initially saw as a confusing amalgamation
				of software tools now is a streamlined chain of programs. I notice the comradery
				encouraged by the sort of activities we engage in, and am genuinely excited to
				be challenged by each time what seemed tacit in my initial conceptualizations is
				unintuitive for a teammate and vice-versa. Blazing through database systems, a
				condensed history of computer science, and basic html/css integration- I feel
				powerful each time I grasp novel concepts. Strangely enough, I even caught myself
				looking forward to the 0800 hard-start each morning with a coding challenge!</p>
			<div id="reflection2">
				<h2> Week 2</h2>
				<p>It's a swan dive into code: week 2 (1? 2? depending on your indexing method, but the second week)
					connected
					me to PHP7 and <i>Pretty Hype People</i>'7' in that the spirit of collaboration is invaluable. We worked
					through
					material i was largely familiar with but had a chance to apply it in lively projects: object oriented
					programming
					demonstrated through a Star Trek thought experiment, the inheritance concept through a table of goofy
					musical instrument
					relationships, and describing UI/UX concepts through a suprisingly robust analogy to a High School
					English
					class.
					Those concepts: front-end, and relatively soft skills compared to our PHP-ducation, initially were more
					difficult
					to apprehend yet as I practiced and applied to the first milestone of our personal website project I
					truly
					took a liking to and have been considering specializing in for future pursuits. On another note, I will
					retain
					the impact of another activity: in groups we were tasked with selecting from a chaos of pictures two that
					represent
					a visual before & after. Working through my ideas from a different perspective was great with a group -
					built my
					communication and group dynamics!
				</p>

				<h2> Week 3</h2>
				<p>It is surreal to recognize I have absorbed this much knowledge in just a week. I feel like i've been
					traveling
					at light speed so time is dilating around me, as the last two days have felt like a month's worth of
					experience
					alone. With the entry into intermediate css I was grooving well with front-end development and with the
					production of
					a more robust representation of code in the final steps of my Data Design project I am enjoying back-end
					as
					well! The
					frustration I experience I feel proud to say is easily conquerable with the combination of my own mantra
					-"trust the
					process" and constant reminders of the support structure and the spirit of comradery in the abq tech
					community
					writ-large. This is
					especially true as I became flustered during the capstone process- how intense! - as ideas came and went
					and
					we
					were assigned
					teams it was hard to start what I know will the bulk of the bootcamp, and yet, as we really got the ball
					rolling on
					whiteboarding and establishing our vision for the capstone, tentatively known as ABQ Outside, I recieved
					instant validation and resulting
					relief. Our week's finale was three guest speakers, and I was ecstatic to hear their pride in DDC and
					optimism
					for the development of the
					ABQ tech scene. Dean Gallagher, the new president/ceo of the New Mexico Tech Council, began his time
					asking
					us
					about our own
					work, and in addition to showing excitment for ABQ Outside, we also discussed new trends such as
					Augmented
					Reality and its interaction
					with art, Blockchain technology and the curve of implementation for that kind of huge shift, and the DART
					initiative to bring larger
					employers to NM.
					All of these make me so excited to hit the ground running Monday for week 4!

				<h1>Re: Demo Day</h1>
				<p> I believe yesterday was a near-perfect way of how the bootcamp model is supposed to be implemented.
					Simultaneously Demo Day served as a graduation ceremony, going-away party, networking mixer, and an all
					around brag sheet for this organization. The combination of the alumni network that is constantly growing
					(and I'm proud to become a member of ) and the employer-instructor loop keeps the curriculum current and
					on-track to code at industry standards. I was rattled walking off the stage after presenting, imagining
					that I had absolutely choked, wearing a programming-themed graphic
					tee alongside my team, to try and match for a sense of cohesion, but leaving me feeling underdressed and
					intimidated...
					until quickly I'm congratulated by an alumnus I've seen as a mentor, assuring me i've made no faux-paus
					grabbing me my blazer to wear on top of the tee and start to shine. He pulls me aside & introduces me,
					now as an equal, to the CEO of a ABQ start-up, talking about how much he liked working with me on the
					Angular Attack 2018 hackathon, until I'm whisked away by the CEO of web-dev "We're a React shop" company
					(also a DDC alum) and so on until when I catch my breath someone's talking about NDA's and I realize I'm
					a developer now.#Abq-Outside!
