			<h2>3 Qualitative features: strength and weakness </h2>
		</div>
			<h3>Empathetic</h3>
			<textarea> can identify with each individual within a complex process and such can often
			piece together an emotional understanding of any problems or animosity that arises
			and, on occasion, have predicted where this could occur and took preventative measures
			Also, I can utilize empathy to be able to communicate effectively to many
			different sorts of individuals -- a colloquialism/social translator --
			Con: I can sometimes value other's emotions too much and have trouble making
			hard decisions.</textarea>
		<h3>Vision--imaginative</h3>
			<textarea>Pros: I am able to synthesize observations, data, and relationships to
			conceive and/or understand underlying causes of everyday things, institutions
			long-standing animosity, etc
			Cons: pseudo naivety--my optimism and vision together can inhibit practical
			Accomplishments, can strain relationships, and let me turn ignore potential
				problems</textarea>

			<h3>Passion</h3>
		<textarea>
			When I find an inherent "why" for a particular project, I am excellent at internalizing
			and pressing on beyond what might be reasonable or normal to dedicate myself until the project is complete
			The flip side of this is my "tunnel vision" can cause me to isolate and perhaps make reckless
			mistakes I would not make in a normal setting. I am working at mitigating this and externalizing,
			periodic reflection/commenting as well as collaborating with a detail-oriented individual are strategies for success.
