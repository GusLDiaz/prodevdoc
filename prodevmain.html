			<h2>3 Qualitative features: strength and weakness </h2>
		</div>
			<h3>Empathetic</h3>
			<p> can identify with each individual within a complex process and such can often
			piece together an emotional understanding of any problems or animosity that arises
			and, on occasion, have predicted where this could occur and took preventative measures
			Also, I can utilize empathy to be able to communicate effectively to many
			different sorts of individuals -- a colloquialism/social translator --
			Con: I can sometimes value other's emotions too much and have trouble making
			hard decisions.</p>
		<h3>Vision--imaginative</h3>
			<p>Pros: I am able to synthesize observations, data, and relationships to
			conceive and/or understand underlying causes of everyday things, institutions
			long-standing animosity, etc
			Cons: pseudo naivety--my optimism and vision together can inhibit practical
			Accomplishments, can strain relationships, and let me turn ignore potential
				problems</p>

			<h3>Passion</h3>
		<p>
			When I find an inherent "why" for a particular project, I am excellent at internalizing
			and pressing on beyond what might be reasonable or normal to dedicate myself until the project is complete
			The flip side of this is my "tunnel vision" can cause me to isolate and perhaps make reckless
			mistakes I would not make in a normal setting. I am working at mitigating this and externalizing,
			periodic reflection/commenting as well as collaborating with a detail-oriented individual are strategies for success.

		<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
		<p>Hey I'm Gus and I'm using technology to bring me people closer together, all through the celebration of good food, and the people that make it. Dining together is tradition, and has built communities for centuries. Want to grab a bite and hear how it works?
		</p>
		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>With a sincere optimism: I understand my chaos. I had trouble waking up until I
			set up an alarm that I have to go across the room to turn off. I appreciate my reasoning
			and problem solving skills- and have reasoned how its most difficult and most rewarding
			to solve my own problems- so when I'm working for a team I know exactly how I Can
			contribute most effectively as well as the pitfalls that can lead me to burdening
			the cause. I argue that recognizing my weakness is not a reason to write me off,
			because the strengths I take pride are rooted in overcoming them. Distractability
			can allow me to identify idiosychrocies and create innovate solutions, but only
			when mitigated with strict time management. My vision, empathy, and optimism can allow
			me to conceptualize awesome things, and potentially to help build my UNICORN ***
			With this in mind I will appreciate the break this weekend represents after an intense
			albeit engaging week 1. From our first minimal-mouse-monday my brain already seems to
			be reconfiguring itself as a <i> developing machine </i>, and even just over the
				course of this first week I recognize what I initially saw as a confusing amalgamation
				of software tools now is a streamlined chain of programs. I notice the comradery
				encouraged by the sort of activities we engage in, and am genuinely excited to
				be challenged by each time what seemed tacit in my initial conceptualizations is
				unintuitive for a teammate and vice-versa. Blazing through database systems, a
				condensed history of computer science, and basic html/css integration- I feel
				powerful each time I grasp novel concepts. Strangely enough, I even caught myself
				looking forward to the 0800 hard-start each morning with a coding challenge!</p>
